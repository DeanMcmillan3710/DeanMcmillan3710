## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a mobile developer building cross-platform applications using Flutter and Firebase. This repository showcases how I design and develop modern mobile apps with real-time functionality, secure authentication, and a strong focus on performance.

A core part of my workflow is integrating Firebaseâ€™s real-time database and Firestore. These tools allow me to sync data instantly across devices and users, making them ideal for apps that require live updatesâ€”like messaging platforms, collaborative tools, or dashboards. I structure data with scalability in mind, using streams and listeners in Flutter to keep the UI reactive and always up-to-date.

I also implement Firebase Authentication to manage secure and reliable user access. Whether it's email/password logins, social sign-ins, or anonymous sessions, I ensure smooth onboarding and session management. Authentication state is tied directly to app navigation and access control, creating a seamless user experience from launch to logout.

Performance is a priority in every app I build. I use Flutterâ€™s profiling tools to monitor frame rates, memory usage, and rendering times. By optimizing widget trees, leveraging lazy loading, and managing state efficiently with providers or Riverpod, I aim to keep the user interface responsiveâ€”even when working with real-time data or limited device resources.

This repository reflects how I approach mobile development: with a clean codebase, modular architecture, and production-ready features built on reliable cloud infrastructure. Whether youâ€™re exploring Flutter and Firebase for the first time or looking to refine your own stack, I hope this project provides helpful patterns, ideas, and inspiration.
